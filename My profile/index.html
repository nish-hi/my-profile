 <p>
	I'm a First Year Student at ESSEC Business School and I'm learning coding as a part of my curriculum. I'm more of a outdoor, sporty and creative person who enjoys grasping every bit of knowledge that I can from all the different parts of the world. I believe the world is a playground full of swings and slides of various colors in the form of opportunities just waiting to be grabbed!
